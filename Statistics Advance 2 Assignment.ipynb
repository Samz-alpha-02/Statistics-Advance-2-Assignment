    "The Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are fundamental concepts\n",
    "in probability and statistics that describe the probabilities or likelihoods of different outcomes or \n",
    "values of a random variable. They apply to different types of random variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Probability Mass Function (PMF):\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition: The PMF is used to describe the probability distribution of a discrete random variable. It \n",
    "            assigns probabilities to each possible value that the random variable can take.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF values are non-negative: P(X = x) ≥ 0 for all possible values of X.\n",

    "summation is taken over all possible values of X.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you're rolling a fair six-sided die. The discrete random variable X represents the outcome of \n",

    "P(X = 5) = 1/6\n",
    "P(X = 6) = 1/6\n",
    "In this case, the PMF assigns equal probabilities (1/6) to each possible outcome.\n",

    "Definition: The PDF is used to describe the probability distribution of a continuous random variable. \n",
    "Unlike the PMF, it doesn't assign probabilities to specific values but instead provides a function \n",

    "Example:\n",

    "Example of a CDF:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have a continuous random variable X representing the heights (in inches) of adult humans. \n",
    "You have a dataset of heights and want to compute the CDF for this data.\n",

    "Step 1: Data Preparation\n",

    "Collect a dataset of human heights: [62, 64, 65, 66, 68, 70, 72, 74, 75, 78].\n",

    "\n",
    "For each value in the sorted dataset, compute the percentage of data points less than or equal to that value. \n",

    "\n",
    "Why CDF is Used:\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF is used for several important purposes in statistics and probability theory:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Quantifying Probabilities: The CDF provides a way to compute and interpret probabilities associated with a \n",

    "                               It helps visualize how data is spread across the entire range of values and provides\n",
    "                               insights into the central tendency and variability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Hypothesis Testing: In hypothesis testing, the CDF is used to calculate critical values, which are important for\n",
    "                      determining whether observed data supports or rejects a hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Calculating Percentiles: Percentiles of a distribution can be calculated using the CDF. For example, the 25th \n",
    "                           percentile corresponds to the value below which 25% of the data falls.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "In summary, the Cumulative Density Function is a crucial tool in statistics for understanding and analyzing the \n",

    "1.Height of Individuals: The heights of adult humans often follow a normal distribution. The mean height \n",

    "                         how much individual heights vary around the mean.\n",

    "2.IQ Scores: IQ (intelligence quotient) scores are often assumed to follow a normal distribution with a mean of \n",

    "2.Standard Deviation (σ): The standard deviation measures the spread or dispersion of the data points around the mean.\n",
    "                          A smaller standard deviation results in a narrower and taller curve, while a larger standard \n",
